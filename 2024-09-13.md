**Crowd Funding** 
can be shift to dot-net stack

I think we need to list and find opensource components. and linked them via API which is true microservices theory. and can be use cloud functions type of things.
let if we want to change we can change those parts easily.

we need mid-tier developers (hands on experience) train them and utilize them. instead of hiring senior resource.

Abdullah bhai should take charge of all tech related jobs.
Project management and customer dealing should be handed over to Shoohira and Aqsa and their team. (we can easily hire that type of persons).

For devOps Abdullah Shahid, Zain and co work.

We build mid-tier good developers to developed the projects.
Abdullah bhai and ARH will provide tech support. And resolve their blockers and guide them.

We can easily complete projects timely.
We are open to chose the stack (like dot-net or python Django)

change alert log path based on the following categories
3 types of servers
- 18c XE
- 21c XE

/opt/oracle/diag/rdbms/free/FREE/trace (23ai)
/u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/orcl_jnb1w9/ORCL/trace (cloud db)
/opt/oracle/diag/rdbms/xe/XE/trace (18c)

cloud-db on oracle cloud (VM)
due to license
- standard
- enterprise

separate machine for ords
zabbix configuration only for ords

alert log on separate server
mount could be an option

path list -> so we can check first if exists then use config dynamically.

## documentation system
