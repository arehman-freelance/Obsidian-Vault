### **Difficult Django ORM and SQL Questions:**

**Question**:  
In Django ORM, what is the N+1 problem, and how would you resolve it? Provide an example where this issue occurs and how you can optimize the query.

**Answer**:  
The N+1 problem occurs when a query to fetch a set of related objects results in additional queries for each individual object, leading to performance degradation. For example:

```python
# Assume we have a One-to-Many relationship: Author -> Book
books = Book.objects.all()
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)

```

In the above code, Django will execute one query to retrieve all books and then execute another query to retrieve the author for each book. This results in N+1 queries.

To resolve it, we can use `select_related` or `prefetch_related`:

- `select_related` is used for ForeignKey and OneToOne relationships.
- `prefetch_related` is used for ManyToMany and reverse ForeignKey relationships.
```python
books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)

```

Now only two queries are executed—one for books and one for the related authors—improving performance significantly.

#### **2. Complex Aggregations with Django ORM:**

**Question**:  
How can you calculate the average price of books per author using Django ORM, but only for authors who have written more than 3 books?

**Answer**:  
This requires a combination of annotations and filtering on aggregated values. Here's how you can achieve it:

```python
from django.db.models import Avg, Count

authors = Author.objects.annotate(book_count=Count('book')).filter(book_count__gt=3).annotate(avg_price=Avg('book__price'))

```

- `Count('book')` counts the number of books per author.
- `filter(book_count__gt=3)` restricts the query to authors with more than 3 books.
- `Avg('book__price')` calculates the average price of books for each author.

This query is both efficient and readable using Django’s ORM features.

#### **3. Subqueries and Django ORM:**

**Question**:  
How would you write a Django ORM query that retrieves all authors who have written a book priced higher than the average price of all books?

**Answer**:  
This can be done using Django’s `Subquery` and `OuterRef` to perform subquery filtering:

```python
from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery, Avg

avg_price = Book.objects.aggregate(Avg('price'))['price__avg']
authors = Author.objects.filter(book__price__gt=avg_price).distinct()

```

- First, we calculate the average price of all books using `aggregate`.
- Then, we filter the authors whose books have a price greater than the average price.
- `distinct()` ensures that each author only appears once, even if they have multiple books above the average price.

#### **4. Handling Complex Many-to-Many Relationships:**

**Question**:  
How do you find all the books that are associated with all categories in a given list using Django ORM? For example, find books that belong to both "Fiction" and "Mystery" categories.

**Answer**:  
You need to perform an intersection of querysets. In Django ORM, you can use `filter` with `all` in combination with `annotate`:

```python
categories = ['Fiction', 'Mystery']
books = Book.objects.filter(categories__name__in=categories).annotate(category_count=Count('categories')).filter(category_count=len(categories))

```

- `filter(categories__name__in=categories)` ensures that we are only considering books with categories in the given list.
- `annotate(category_count=Count('categories'))` counts how many categories are associated with each book.
- `filter(category_count=len(categories))` ensures that only books associated with both categories are returned.
#### **5. Advanced Query: Self-referencing and Recursive Queries in Django ORM:**

**Question**:  
How would you query all descendants of a category in a self-referencing Category model (e.g., a category tree) using Django ORM?

**Answer**:  
Django ORM doesn't directly support recursive queries, but you can achieve this using raw SQL or a combination of Django and PostgreSQL’s Common Table Expressions (CTEs). For Django 3.0+ with PostgreSQL, you can use the `django-cte` library or raw SQL.

For a raw SQL query, you could do something like:

```python
from django.db import connection

with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
    WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
        SELECT id, parent_id, name FROM category WHERE id = %s
        UNION ALL
        SELECT c.id, c.parent_id, c.name FROM category c
        INNER JOIN category_tree ct ON ct.id = c.parent_id
    )
    SELECT * FROM category_tree;
    """, [parent_category_id])

    rows = cursor.fetchall()

```
This query uses a recursive CTE to fetch all descendants of a given category.

#### **6. Transactions in Django ORM:**

**Question**:  
How do you handle atomic transactions in Django, ensuring that multiple operations either succeed or fail together?

**Answer**:  
Django provides the `transaction.atomic` context manager to ensure that a block of code is wrapped in a transaction:

```python
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def create_book_with_author(author_data, book_data):
    author = Author.objects.create(**author_data)
    book = Book.objects.create(author=author, **book_data)

```
If any part of the code within the `atomic` block raises an exception, the transaction will be rolled back, ensuring that the database remains consistent.

Django’s `atomic` also supports nesting and can be used in more complex cases by managing different layers of transactions. You can control this behavior with `savepoints`.

#### **7. Querying with Window Functions in Django ORM (PostgreSQL only)**:

**Question**:  
How would you retrieve the rank of books based on their price within each category using Django's ORM?

**Answer**:  
For PostgreSQL, you can use window functions via `django.contrib.postgres`:

```python
from django.db.models import Window
from django.db.models.functions import Rank

books = Book.objects.annotate(rank=Window(expression=Rank(), partition_by='category', order_by=F('price').desc()))

```

- `Rank()` computes the rank of each book within its category.
- `partition_by='category'` ensures that ranking is reset for each category.
- `order_by=F('price').desc()` ranks books by price in descending order within each category.

This gives you the rank of each book based on its price in its respective category.

### **Conceptual Depth:**

- **Django ORM Lazy Evaluation**: Django ORM queries are lazily evaluated. This means that Django doesn't hit the database until the queryset is actually evaluated (e.g., by iterating over it, slicing it, or converting it to a list). Understanding this is critical when chaining filters or using complex querysets to avoid redundant queries and optimize performance.
    
- **Raw SQL in Django**: In cases where Django ORM falls short, you can always use raw SQL queries via `raw()` or `connection.cursor()` to execute complex SQL that can’t be easily expressed with the ORM.

### **SQL Queries**
#### **1. Querying Hierarchical Data with Recursive CTEs**

**Scenario**:  
You have an `employees` table with a self-referencing `manager_id` column, representing the hierarchy of employees. Write a query that retrieves all employees and their level in the hierarchy.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Root employee (CEO or top-level manager)
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON eh.id = e.manager_id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;

```
**Concept**:  
This query uses a recursive CTE to traverse hierarchical data. The `level` column tracks how deep each employee is in the hierarchy, starting from the top-most manager (CEO).

#### **2. Finding the Second Highest Salary**

**Scenario**:  
You have an `employees` table and need to find the second-highest salary without using `LIMIT` or `OFFSET`.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

```

**Concept**:  
This query finds the highest salary in the subquery and then looks for the maximum salary that is less than the highest one, thus returning the second-highest value. This avoids using `LIMIT` or `OFFSET`, often required in databases that don’t support them well.

#### **3. Dealing with Gaps in Date Ranges**

**Scenario**:  
Given a `rentals` table with columns `rental_start` and `rental_end`, find all the gaps between rentals (i.e., periods where no rental occurs).

```python
SELECT r1.rental_end, r2.rental_start
FROM rentals r1
JOIN rentals r2 ON r1.rental_end < r2.rental_start
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM rentals r3
    WHERE r3.rental_start BETWEEN r1.rental_end AND r2.rental_start
)
ORDER BY r1.rental_end;

```

**Concept**:  
This query joins the table with itself to find rental periods that don’t overlap. The `NOT EXISTS` clause ensures that no rentals occur between `r1.rental_end` and `r2.rental_start`, effectively identifying gaps.

#### **4. Finding Overlapping Time Ranges**

**Scenario**:  
You have a `bookings` table with `start_time` and `end_time` columns. Write a query to find all pairs of bookings that overlap.

```sql
SELECT b1.id AS booking1, b2.id AS booking2
FROM bookings b1
JOIN bookings b2 ON b1.id != b2.id
AND b1.start_time < b2.end_time
AND b1.end_time > b2.start_time;

```

**Concept**:  
This query checks for overlapping time ranges by ensuring that one booking’s start time occurs before another’s end time, and its end time occurs after another’s start time. This is useful for resource scheduling, detecting conflicts, etc.

#### **5. Query for Finding Consecutive Rows (Gaps-and-Islands Problem)**

**Scenario**:  
You have a `logins` table with `user_id` and `login_date`. You want to find consecutive login streaks for users, where they logged in on consecutive days.

```sql
SELECT user_id, MIN(login_date) AS streak_start, MAX(login_date) AS streak_end
FROM (
    SELECT user_id, login_date, login_date - INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY login_date) DAY AS grp
    FROM logins
) AS grouped_logins
GROUP BY user_id, grp;

```
**Concept**:  
This query solves the "gaps-and-islands" problem by using window functions. It partitions the rows by `user_id`, and the difference between `login_date` and the row number creates "islands" of consecutive dates, which are grouped to find the streaks.

#### **6. Aggregating Data with Conditional Logic**

**Scenario**:  
Given an `orders` table, write a query that retrieves the total sales and the number of orders for each customer, but only if they have placed more than 5 orders.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_sales, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

```
**Concept**:  
The `HAVING` clause is used here to filter out customers who haven’t placed more than 5 orders. This is different from `WHERE` because `HAVING` applies to aggregated results.

#### **7. Ranking and Dense Ranking of Records**

**Scenario**:  
You have a `students` table with `name` and `score`. Write a query to rank students by their score, where ties receive the same rank, but the next rank skips ahead (like Olympic-style ranking).

```sql
SELECT name, score, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM students;

```

**Concept**:  
The `RANK()` window function provides a rank for each student, with ties sharing the same rank and the next rank skipping ahead (e.g., ranks could be 1, 2, 2, 4, 5).

#### **8. Pivoting Data (Dynamic Columns)**

**Scenario**:  
You have a `sales` table with columns `region`, `month`, and `sales`. Write a query to pivot the data, showing each region's sales across months as columns.

```sql
SELECT region,
       SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'January' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS January,
       SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'February' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS February,
       SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'March' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS March
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;

```
**Concept**:  
This query manually pivots the `sales` data, turning rows into columns using `CASE` statements. Each `CASE` checks the value of `month` and sums sales for that particular month
